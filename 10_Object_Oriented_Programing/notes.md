# JavaScript and Classes

## Question 1

Does javaScript really have classes?

**Answer:**
Yes JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification(ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and it's classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritence mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar
syntax for the developers coming from class based languages such as Java or C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.

## OOPS

## Object

- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Why use OOPs?

## Parts of OOPS

- Object Literal
- Constructor funtion
- Prototypes / Proto
- Classes
- Instances(new, this)

## 4 Pillars of OOPs

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

## Prototype

- We get classes, this keyword, new keyword, inheritence in javaScript because of prototype behaviour.

- JavaScript has a prototype behaviour, i.e., it will keep on searching the child class, then the parent class, the grandparent class, the grand grandparent class until it gets the null value.
